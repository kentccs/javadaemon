# javadaemon

This is a project showing Java daemon service in JSVC architecture.
Its efficient and run proprietary library for HTML UNIT.

Now life is even better. 
The evolvement of dependencies management using maven or gradle.
Spring framework 4 with spring security, apache shiro security,
json mapper like jackson, 
ORM tools like hibernate
This daemon can therefore be upgraded and we would not have to make our
own database pools.
